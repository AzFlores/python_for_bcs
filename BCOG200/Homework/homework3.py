    1. what happens if you try to open a file that is already open? type your answer as a comment.
'''
# type your answer here

    2. how do you only read the first 10 characters of a file? type your answer as working python code in the space
        indicated below.    
'''
print("Output of question #2")
# your code for #2 goes here
print()

    3.  write code that reads in file 'test_file2.txt', creates a separate file for each geographic region 
        the animals are from, and prints only the animals from that region to the file, one animal per line.
        for example, you should create the file 'africa.txt', and that file should have:
        
        elephant
        lion
        giraffe
        zebra
        hyena
        
        also, the program cannot "hard code" the names of the files. You need to figure out the names of the output 
        files from the input files. For example, if I test your code on a new input file that has animals from china, or
        antarctica, or Wonderland, the program should still work!

    4.  write code where you enter numbers using the input

print("Output of question #4")
# your code for #4 goes here
print()
